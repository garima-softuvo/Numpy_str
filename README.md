# Numpy_Doc_String
We are writing the code in the numpy doc string.

# To get the clear view of the doc string, you can use 
import inspect
print(inspect.getdoc(the_function_name))

# You can get example_numpy.py here
https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/example_numpy.html 

# For the basic python OOPs code that has been used, you can get it from the link given below:

https://github.com/codebasics/py/blob/master/Basics/17_class.pys

Also, instead of using:
print(function_name.__doc__) as __doc__ attribute contains the raw docstring i.e. tabs or spaces, So to get the clear version  use getdoc() from inspect module i.e. print(inspect.getdoc(function_name))
